# homebrew-formulae

Custom SeatGeek Formula for Homebrew

## Requirements

- Homebrew
- OS X 10.7. Untested on versions below, YMMV
- Patience

## Installation


You'll want to tap this repository:

    brew tap avisri/formulae

And now you can install any of our formula as necessary.


## Available formulae

The following formulae will be available when you tap this repository.

### Nginx-Sg

> Allows for customized nginx installations

**Install with** `brew install nginx-sg`

Lines 27-33, 66-73, and 82-98 are the patches to the real existing nginx formula in homebrew.

Usage:

* `--add-github-module=USERNAME/REPOSITORY`: Adds an nginx module from github. Requires `git`.
* `--add-mdounin-module=MODULE_NAME`: Adds an nginx module from mdounin's hg repo (http://mdounin.ru/hg/)
* `--include-module-MODULE_NAME`: Adds the `--with-MODULE_NAME` flag for a module that comes with the nginx source but not enabled by default

Example:

		brew install nginx-sg \
			--add-github-module=agentzh/chunkin-nginx-module \
			--include-module-http_gzip_static_module \
			--add-mdounin-module=ngx_http_auth_request_module#a29d74804ff1

Running the above on the commandline produces the following output:

		$ brew install ./nginx-sg.rb --add-github-module=avisri/chunkin-nginx-module --include-module-http_gzip_static_module --add-mdounin-module=ngx_http_auth_request_module#a29d74804ff1

		==> Patching
		patching file conf/nginx.conf
		adding extra modules
		- adding http_gzip_static_module module
		- adding agentzh from github...
		- adding ngx_http_auth_request_module from mdounin...
		==> ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/Cellar/nginx-sg/1.2.4 --with-http_ssl_module --with-pcre --with-ipv6 --with-cc-opt=-I/usr/local/include --with-ld-opt=-L/usr/local/lib --conf-path=/usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf --pid-path=/usr/local/var/run/nginx.pid --lock-path=/
		==> make
		==> make install
		==> Caveats
		In the interest of allowing you to run `nginx` without `sudo`, the default
		port is set to localhost:8080.

		If you want to host pages on your local machine to the public, you should
		change that to localhost:80, and run `sudo nginx`. You'll need to turn off
		any other web servers running port 80, of course.

		You can start nginx automatically on login running as your user with:
		  mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents
		  cp /usr/local/Cellar/nginx-sg/1.2.4/homebrew.mxcl.nginx-sg.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
		  launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.nginx-sg.plist

		Though note that if running as your user, the launch agent will fail if you
		try to use a port below 1024 (such as http's default of 80.)
		==> Summary
		/usr/local/Cellar/nginx-sg/1.2.4: 9 files, 900K, built in 28 seconds
